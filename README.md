Reinforcement Learning (CS 138) Assignment 1

<i>Exercise 2.5 (programming)</i> Design and conduct an experiment to demonstrate the diffculties that sample-average methods have for nonstationary problems. Use a modified version of the 10-armed testbed in which all the $q_{1}(a)$ start out equal and then take independent random walks (say by adding a normally distributed increment with mean zero and standard deviation 0.01 to all the $q_{1}(a)$ on each step). Prepare plots like Figure 2.2 for an action-value method using sample averages, incrementally computed, and another action-value method using a constant step-size parameter, $\varepsilon$ = 0.1. Use $\alpha$ = 0.1 and longer runs, say of 10,000 steps.
